# Image Assets – Non‑Source Documentation

The `images/` folder contains only visual assets that illustrate the project's structure and functionality. These assets are **not** part of the executable source code or build artifacts; they exist solely to support documentation, features and design reviews.

All project images are presented below for quick reference:

|                                              |                                               |
|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| ![Input](input.png)                          | ![Output](output.png)                         |
| ![Gradio](gradio.png) via `python gr_app.py` | ![Gradio](gradio2.png) via `python gr_app.py` |

> Some assets should be referenced by the root's `README.md`.

**Reminder:** The images may not represent the final project.
